# Moto_Service_App

Motorcycles are the most affordable transport mode in Sri Lanka, and for most of the population, 
they are also the most common type of motor vehicle. However, as we all know it is very difficult to 
find a bike service center when we ran in to an emergency on road. Because there are only limited 
number of service centers are available and most of them didn’t have a proper communication method. 
Therefore, in such cases people have to face a lot of problems.

“Moto Service” is a bike servicing app focused on Sri Lankan community that connects bike 
owners(customers) and the service center directly. The main intention of this app is to provide best 
solutions for the problems that the motorcycle users face during emergencies. Also, this app contains 
smart characteristics such as less keyboarding, social media and network capabilities, security methods 
and search options, which makes it easy for the user to use the app. Any person from any area can get 
services from this app, and they can get a very quick service within few steps.
